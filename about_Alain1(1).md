## Describe a challenging situation where you had to communicate technical issues to non-technical stakeholders. How did you handle it?fn

I encountered a challenging situation at Dominion Systems INC <where I had to communicate technical issues to non-technical stakeholders>. 

We were in the midst of a complex cloud migration project, and we <faced an unexpected downtime event> due to an issue in our cloud infrastructure. 
While my technical team and I were actively working to resolve the issue, it was essential to keep our non-technical stakeholders, including project managers and executives, informed.

So the way I handled this situation was:

- <Immediate Notification>: <First, I ensured that the non-technical stakeholders were notified promptly. I sent out an initial communication detailing the issue, the impact and our team's active efforts to resolve it. I used non-technical language to convey the urgency of the situation.

- Regular Updates <Throughout the incident, I provided regular updates to the stakeholders, keeping them informed about our progress. These updates were concise and focused on key points, such as the actions we were taking, the expected resolution time, and any potential implications for the project.

- Risk Mitigation Plan <I also discussed our risk mitigation plan, explaining the steps we were taking to prevent a similar issue from happening in the future. This proactive approach reassured the stakeholders that we were taking the incident seriously and implementing measures to prevent its recurrence.

- Addressing Concerns <I encouraged stakeholders to ask questions and express their concerns. I provided clear and straightforward answers to their questions, even if it meant simplifying complex technical details into terms they could understand.

- Post-Incident Review <After resolving the issue, I conducted a post-incident review with the stakeholders. This session allowed us to <discuss the root causes, preventive measures, and lessons learned>. It provided a sense of closure and assurance that we had a plan in place to prevent similar issues.


## Can you share an example of a successful project you've worked on that had a significant impact on your organization?

One of the most impactful projects I've worked on at Dominion was a project we had to <migrate  one of our client critical application to cloud and also to set up their CI/CD pipeline>. The project was aimed to streamline software development and deployment. The application was central to their core banking operation which made its successful migration and improvement a top priority for us

1. First implemented <CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Terraform, GitHub. The pipeline automated the code integration, build, testing, and deployment processes which eliminated manual interventions and reduced the risk of human error.

2. Next we <We thoroughly planned the migration of the application to AWS. We did so by leveraging services like EC2, RDS, and S3. The migration involved re-architecting the application for better scalability and reliability in the cloud environment.

3. In order to improve Code Quality  and <With the CI/CD pipeline in place, we implemented systematic code misconfiguration checks, ensuring high code quality and security standards> This significantly reduced the likelihood of code-related issues and vulnerabilities.

4. Collaboration: <Throughout the project, I collaborated closely with both technical and non-technical teams, ensuring that all stakeholders were aligned and informed> This transparent communication was essential for the project's success.

* The impact of this project was remarkable:

- <Faster Deployment as it let to 50% reduction in deployment times which enabled us to release critical updates and features more rapidly> .

- <The application uptime and reliability significantly improved  minimizing downtime and user disruptions.

- Enhanced Security: <The systematic code checks and security configurations resulted in a more secure application, reducing the risk of security breaches.

- Cost Savings: <due to automation and cloud optimization, we could efficiently scale resources based on demand.

- Efficient Collaboration: <The project promoted a culture of collaboration and innovation, strengthening our team's ability to work cohesively.

This project had a substantial positive impact on our organization. It not only improved the performance and security of a critical application but also set a precedent for further automation and cloud adoption across the company. The success of this project reinforced the value of DevOps practices and the potential for significant positive change within our organization.





## Describe a situation where a critical application went down. How did you troubleshoot and resolve the issue?

Feature of <key applications went down unexpectedly>. This application was integral to our client core banking operations, and its downtime could lead to significant disruptions. 

**Immediate Response:**
1. **Alert Notification:** was promptly triggered by our monitoring system. The team and I received immediate alerts about the application's downtime.

2. **Alert Prioritization:** I quickly assessed the <severity of the issue so that we could prioritize> as critical. This allowed us to allocate necessary resources and attention for quick resolution.

**Investigation and Troubleshooting:**
3. **Log Analysis:** I began by <analyzing application logs, system logs, and cloud infrastructure logs. This helped me in quickly pinpointing the root cause of the issue>.

4. **Resource Monitoring:** Concurrently, we monitored the resources in use, such as CPU, memory, and network activity, to identify any abnormal resource consumption patterns.

5. **Code Review:** We also did a code review to <identify any recent changes or code deployments that might have triggered the issue. 

**Isolation and Temporary Fix:**
6. **Service Isolation:** <Based on the initial findings, we isolated the affected service to prevent any further impact on other components of the application.

7. **Temporary Mitigation:** <We implemented a temporary fix to restore the service's functionality and minimize the impact on our operations.

**Resolution and Preventive Measures:**
8. **Collaboration:**   <we had open communication with the development and operations teams> throughout. This collaboration ensured that all stakeholders were aligned and informed.

9. **Root Cause Analysis:**  This analysis revealed a configuration change in the cloud environment that led to resource constraints.

10. **Permanent Fix:** We addressed the root cause by adjusting the cloud resources and configurations, ensuring that the issue would not recur. This involved modifying resource limits and implementing proactive scaling policies.

**Communication:**
11. **Status Updates:** We provided regular status updates to senior management and other stakeholders, keeping them informed about our progress and the measures taken to prevent similar incidents.

12. **Post-Incident Review:** Following the resolution, we held a post-incident review to document the lessons learned and to strengthen our incident response procedures.

Through these steps, we successfully resolved the critical application downtime. The incident reinforced the importance of robust monitoring, open communication, and a systematic approach to troubleshooting. It also highlighted the need for proactive measures to prevent similar issues in the future, including cloud resource optimization and scaling policies."
